== Installation ==
To install, simply upload using FTP or a file transfer program of your choice, create a MySQL database and visit the _installer directory - it's all downhill from there!

Know of someone selling this software? Drop me an e-mail at software_abuse@matthewgall.info or contact me by private message at clubhabboforum.net (Username: iCame).

== Things To Note ==
- In order for a user to be able to view the panel, he *must* have the "User"
  usergroup selected - without it he'll be unable to access the core functions
  of the script!

- All frontend files are located in _frontend - they're deliberately simple
  and therefore easy to integrate into your site. Should you need any assistance
  with these just contact Josh on ClubHabbo Forum.
