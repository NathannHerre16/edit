## Licence
radiPanel: RC2 (Edited) is licenced under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 UK: England & Wales Licence](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/)

## Installation
To install, simply upload using FTP or a file transfer program of your choice, create a MySQL database and visit the _installer directory - it's all downhill from there!

## Things To Note
* In order for a user to be able to view the panel, he *must* have the "User"
  usergroup selected - without it he'll be unable to access the core functions
  of the script!
* All frontend files are located in _frontend - they're deliberately simple
  and therefore easy to integrate into your site. Should you need any assistance
  with these just contact Josh on ClubHabbo Forum.
* To addon developers, if your addon isn't included it would probably be for one of the following reasons:
    + Your addon release page doesn't mention a licence; or
    + Your addon licence included additional terms (such as right of removal on request); or
    + The licence your addon is released under is not compatible with the parent product licence.

If you are a developer and your addon has been missed, please create an issue over on the [issue tracker](https://bitbucket.org/radipanel/edit/issues) (requires registration) to find out the reasons for it's non inclusion.
